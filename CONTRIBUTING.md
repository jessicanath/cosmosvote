## Smart Contract Development

### Adding a new contract function
- Add the public function in `contracts/<contract>/src/lib.rs`.
- Add any required storage accessors in `contracts/<contract>/src/storage.rs`.
- Add new errors to `contracts/<contract>/src/types.rs` when needed.
- Add on-chain events in `contracts/<contract>/src/events.rs` for state changes.
- Privileged functions must call `require_auth()` and validate inputs.

### Writing unit tests
- Add unit tests in `contracts/<contract>/src/test.rs`.
- Use `Env::default()` and `env.mock_all_auths()`.
- Register the contract client, initialize it, and exercise the new API.
- Test both success and failure conditions using `try_*` helpers.
- Verify state changes with `assert_eq!` and event behavior where applicable.

### Adding property tests
- Add property-based tests in `contracts/<contract>/src/prop_tests.rs`.
- Use `proptest::prelude::*` and clear invariants.
- Keep property tests focused on safety invariants such as no double-vote, supply limits, or authorization guarantees.
- Use `prop_assert!` / `prop_assert_eq!` for assertions.

### Updating events
- Add new event emission methods in `contracts/<contract>/src/events.rs`.
- Emit events for every meaningful state transition or admin action.
- Use consistent event symbols and payload ordering.

### Updating storage
- Update `InstanceKey`, `PersistentKey`, or `TempKey` enums in `contracts/<contract>/src/storage.rs`.
- Add helper getters/setters for new storage fields.
- Keep storage keys stable and avoid changing existing keys unless necessary.

## Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch is protected. Direct pushes to `main` are disabled. To merge changes into `main`, the following rules are enforced:
- **Require a pull request before merging:** All changes must be made through a PR.
- **Require approvals:** At least 1 review approval is required.
- **Require status checks to pass before merging:** CI checks (build, test, lint) must pass.
- **Do not allow bypassing the above settings:** Administrators must also follow these rules.
- **Restrict force pushes:** Force pushes to `main` are not allowed.

### Enabling Branch Protection (For Admins)
To configure these rules via GitHub repository settings:
1. Go to the repository **Settings** > **Branches**.
2. Click **Add branch protection rule**.
3. Set **Branch name pattern** to `main`.
4. Check **Require a pull request before merging**, and set **Require approvals** to 1.
5. Check **Require status checks to pass before merging** and require your CI checks.
6. Check **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**.
7. Ensure **Allow force pushes** is unchecked.
8. Click **Create** or **Save changes**.

## License Compliance

CosmosVote is Apache 2.0 licensed. All dependencies must use compatible permissive licenses. CI enforces this automatically on every PR.

### Allowed licenses

| License | Rust (cargo-deny) | Frontend (license-checker) |
|---|---|---|
| Apache-2.0 | ✅ | ✅ |
| MIT | ✅ | ✅ |
| BSD-2-Clause | ✅ | ✅ |
| BSD-3-Clause | ✅ | ✅ |
| ISC | ✅ | ✅ |
| CC0-1.0 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Zlib | ✅ | — |
| Unicode-DFS-2016 / Unicode-3.0 | ✅ | — |
| Unlicense / 0BSD | — | ✅ |

### Denied licenses

GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, LGPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0, EUPL-1.1, EUPL-1.2, SSPL-1.0, BUSL-1.1 — and any unknown or unlicensed dependency.

### Adding a dependency with an unlisted license

1. Verify the license is permissive and compatible with Apache 2.0.
2. Add it to the `allow` list in `deny.toml` (Rust) or to `--onlyAllow` in the `license-check` script in `frontend/package.json`.
3. Add a note in your PR explaining the addition.

### Running checks locally

```bash
# Rust
cargo install cargo-deny --locked
cargo deny check licenses

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run license-check
```

## Coding Standards

- Follow existing code style and module structure
- Use `checked_add` / `checked_sub` for all arithmetic on token amounts
- All public contract functions must call `require_auth()` on the caller
- Storage keys must use the established `InstanceKey` / `PersistentKey` / `TempKey` enums
- Emit events for every state transition
- Error codes must be added to `ContractError` with a unique `u32` discriminant

## Code Style & Repository Conventions

### Rust

- Format all Rust code with `rustfmt` before committing (`make fmt`).
- No Clippy warnings are allowed; fix all warnings before opening a PR (`make lint`).
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for types and enums, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Keep functions focused — prefer small, single-responsibility functions.
- Use `checked_add` / `checked_sub` for arithmetic on any numeric value that can overflow.
- Return `Result<T, ContractError>` from all fallible contract entry points.
- Avoid `unwrap()` / `expect()` in contract code; propagate errors with `?`.
- Document public functions with a `///` doc comment explaining purpose, parameters, and errors.

```rust
// Good
/// Returns the current proposal count.
pub fn proposal_count(env: Env) -> u64 {
    storage::get_proposal_count(&env)
}

// Bad — no doc, uses unwrap
pub fn proposal_count(env: Env) -> u64 {
    env.storage().instance().get(&InstanceKey::ProposalCount).unwrap()
}
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- All files must pass ESLint with zero warnings: `npm run lint` from `frontend/`.
- All files must type-check: `npm run type-check`.
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for types, interfaces, and React components.
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes; use `type` for unions and aliases.
- Use explicit return types on exported functions.
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` and narrow types explicitly.
- Use `async/await` over `.then()` chains.

```typescript
// Good
export async function fetchProposalCount(): Promise<number> {
  const count = await simulateCall(config.governanceContractId, 'proposal_count');
  return Number(count);
}

// Bad — implicit any, no return type
export async function fetchProposalCount() {
  const count: any = await simulateCall(config.governanceContractId, 'proposal_count');
  return count;
}
```

### Shell Scripts

- All scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail`.
- Quote all variable expansions: `"${VAR}"` not `$VAR`.
- Use `snake_case` for local variables and function names.
- Add a brief comment above each logical block explaining what it does.
- Do not hard-code secrets or keys; read them from environment variables.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Deploy governance contract to the configured network
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm "${WASM_PATH}" \
  --source "${STELLAR_SECRET_KEY}" \
  --network "${NETWORK}"
```

### Branch Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/<short-description>` | `feat/proposal-delegation` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<short-description>` | `fix/quorum-bypass` |
| Documentation | `docs/<short-description>` | `docs/api-reference` |
| Chore / tooling | `chore/<short-description>` | `chore/update-deps` |
| Release | `release/v<version>` | `release/v1.2.0` |

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only — no underscores or slashes beyond the prefix.
- Keep names concise (≤ 40 characters after the prefix).

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short summary>

<optional body>

<optional footer: Closes #issue>
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`.

```
# Good
feat(governance): add proposal delegation support

Allows token holders to delegate voting power to another address.

Closes #42

# Bad
updated stuff
```

- Keep the subject line ≤ 72 characters.
- Use the imperative mood: "add", "fix", "update" — not "added", "fixed", "updated".
- Reference the issue number in the footer: `Closes #<number>`.

### Pull Request Expectations

- Target `main` branch.
- Title follows the same Conventional Commits format as commit messages.
- Description must include: **What** changed, **Why**, and **How to test**.
- Link the relevant issue with `Closes #<number>` in the PR description.
- Keep PRs focused — one issue or feature per PR.
- Self-review your diff before requesting review.
- Ensure `make fmt`, `make lint`, and `make test` all pass locally before pushing.

### Lint Rules Summary

| Language | Tool | Command | Config |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| Rust | Clippy | `make lint` | `clippy.toml` / inline `#[allow]` |
| Rust | rustfmt | `make fmt` | `rustfmt.toml` |
| TypeScript | ESLint | `npm run lint` (in `frontend/`) | `.eslintrc` |
| TypeScript | tsc | `npm run type-check` | `tsconfig.json` |

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests go in `src/test.rs`
- Test helpers go in `src/test_helpers.rs`
- Property-based tests go in `src/prop_tests.rs`
- Use `env.mock_all_auths()` in tests
- Test both success and failure paths for every public function
- **Coverage Target:** All contributions must maintain at least **80% code coverage**. The CI will fail if coverage drops below this threshold.

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.
