# Incident Post-Mortem Template

Use this template for every production incident that causes user-visible impact or requires an emergency response. Complete all sections within 48 hours of resolution.

> **How to use:** copy this file to `docs/postmortems/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, fill in each section, and open a PR for team review. Blameless culture — focus on systems and processes, not individuals.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What happened?

<!-- Technical explanation of the failure. Be specific: which function, which state transition, which edge case. -->

### Why did it happen?

<!-- Underlying cause — misconfiguration, logic bug, dependency failure, etc. Use the 5-Whys technique if helpful. -->

**5-Whys:**
1. Why? —
2. Why? —
3. Why? —
4. Why? —
5. Why? —

### Contributing factors

<!-- List any conditions that made the incident worse or harder to detect. -->

## Impact Assessment

| Dimension | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Users affected** | e.g. all voters during the window, proposers only |
| **Proposals affected** | IDs of any proposals whose state was incorrect or inaccessible |
| **Votes lost / corrupted** | number and addresses if known |
| **Financial impact** | e.g. none / estimated gas costs / token loss |
| **Data integrity** | on-chain state consistent / inconsistent — explain |
| **Regulatory / compliance** | any audit trail gaps |

---

## Action Items

Each item must have an owner and a due date.

| # | Action | Owner | Due date | Status |
|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | | @handle | YYYY-MM-DD | Open |
| 2 | | @handle | YYYY-MM-DD | Open |
| 3 | | @handle | YYYY-MM-DD | Open |

Action item categories to consider:
- **Prevent recurrence** — code fix, config change, additional validation
- **Improve detection** — new alert, monitoring dashboard, event index
- **Improve response** — runbook update, on-call training, escalation path
- **Reduce blast radius** — pause automation, circuit breaker, rate limiting

## Lessons Learned

### What went well?

<!-- Detection, communication, tooling, or response steps that worked effectively. -->

- 
- 

### What went poorly?

<!-- Gaps in tooling, process, knowledge, or communication that slowed the response. -->

- 
- 

### Where did we get lucky?

<!-- Near-misses or assumptions that happened to be correct this time. -->
