## `initialize`

```rust
pub fn initialize(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    voting_token: Address,
    min_proposal_balance: i128,
    proposal_cooldown: u64,
    min_quorum_bps: u32,
    restrict_admin_vote: bool,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `admin` | `Address` | Privileged address for execute/cancel/pause operations |
| `voting_token` | `Address` | SEP-41 governance token contract address |
| `min_proposal_balance` | `i128` | Minimum token balance required to create a proposal (`0` = no minimum) |
| `proposal_cooldown` | `u64` | Seconds a proposer must wait between proposals (`0` = no cooldown) |
| `min_quorum_bps` | `u32` | Minimum quorum floor in basis points, e.g. `500` = 5% (`0` = no floor) |
| `restrict_admin_vote` | `bool` | If `true`, admin cannot vote on proposals they created |

**Returns:** `Ok(())` on success.

**Errors:** `AlreadyInitialized (1)` if called more than once.

**Example**

```rust
gov.initialize(
    &admin,
    &token_id,
    &1_000_000i128, // 1M token minimum to propose
    &86_400u64,     // 1-day cooldown
    &500u32,        // 5% quorum floor
    &true,          // admin cannot vote on own proposals
);
```

---

```

**Returns:** `Ok(Proposal)` with all proposal fields.

**Errors:** `ProposalNotFound (10)` if the ID does not exist.

---

## `proposal_count`

```rust

---

## `get_proposals`

```rust
pub fn get_proposals(env: Env, from_id: u64, limit: u32) -> Vec<Proposal>
```

Paginated list of proposals. `limit` is capped at 20.

---

## `get_proposals_by_state`

```rust
pub fn get_proposals_by_state(
    env: Env,
    state: ProposalState,
    from_id: u64,
    limit: u32,
) -> Vec<Proposal>
```

Paginated list filtered by `ProposalState`. `limit` is capped at 20.

---

## `cast_vote`

```rust
pub fn cast_vote(

## `get_vote`

```rust
pub fn get_vote(env: Env, proposal_id: u64, voter: Address) -> Result<VoteRecord, ContractError>
```

**Returns:** `Ok(VoteRecord { vote, weight })` for the voter's recorded vote.

**Errors:** `VoteNotFound (27)` if the voter has not voted.

---

## `finalise`

```rust
pub fn finalise(env: Env, proposal_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Finalizes a proposal after its voting period ends. Anyone may call this.

    admin: Address,
    proposal_id: u64,
    new_quorum: i128,
) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

Updates the quorum on an active proposal. Only allowed before any votes are cast. Admin only.

**Errors:** `QuorumUpdateNotAllowed (32)` if votes have already been cast.

---

## `transfer_admin`

```rust
pub fn transfer_admin(env: Env, admin: Address, new_admin: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
